# Master project

## Introduction

This is a github repository that gathers the main scripts used in the frame of my master project as well as documentation to try and present the main steps of each procedure. The repository is under construction and more documentation will be added soon.

## Structure of the repository

- Data folder: gathers input data and output of the notebooks. However, most of the data is not pushed online (cf. gitignore) because of its size.
- Notebooks: jupyter notebooks that can be ran locally (because they are not too computationally expensive, do not need too big input data and do not generate too big output data)
- Scripts: python scripts that are ran on vancouver server. More documentation will be added to them in order to clarify their goal.
- Workflows: Additional documentation (more to come).
